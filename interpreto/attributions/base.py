                    - Classification (single class): `(l,)`
                    - Classification (all classes): `(l, c)`, where `c` is the number of classes.

                        - For generated elements, scores are zero for previously generated tokens.
                    - Token classification: `(l, l_t)`, where `l_t` is the number of token classes. When the tokens are disturbed, l = l_t.

            elements (Iterable[list[str]] | Iterable[torch.Tensor] | None, optional): A list or tensor representing the elements for which attributions are computed.
